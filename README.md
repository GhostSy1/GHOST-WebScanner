# GHOST-WebScanner

Professional red team assessment and artifact analysis utility. Developed by Abdulaziz (Ghost-SY1).

## Overview

`GHOST-WebScanner` is an advanced, production-grade security utility built under the Ghost-SY1 v4.0-PRO standard. It specializes in `Web asset inventory and response security inspector`, parsing local artifacts, calculating SHA-256 integrity hashes, evaluating security rule sets, and generating structured JSON, CSV, SARIF 2.1.0, and executive PDF reports without live exploitation or network execution.

## Key Features & Benefits

- **Strict Zero-Simulation Engine**: Operates exclusively on real local operator-provided inputs.
- **Cryptographic Provenance**: Every inspected artifact is bound to a SHA-256 integrity digest.
- **Multi-Format Reporting**: Native export to JSON, CSV, SARIF 2.1.0, and ReportLab PDF.
- **Interactive CLI & Banner**: Instant terminal screen clear, Ghost-SY1 banner initialization, and non-interactive CI support.

## Use Cases

- Authorized red team security audits and configuration reviews.
- Evidence collection, provenance tracking, and reporting for executive leadership.
- Integration into CI/CD security validation pipelines.
