## Overview & Purpose
**GHOST-WebScanner** is an advanced, production-grade cybersecurity tool developed under the **Ghost-SY1** framework. It is designed to perform rigorous security evaluation, automated auditing, or asset intelligence for enterprise environments under strict operational authorizations.

---

## Problem Solved
Security teams and penetration testers frequently deal with fragmented tooling, inconsistent output schemas, and lack of reproducible evidence chains. **GHOST-WebScanner** standardizes execution flow, clears terminal buffers, presents verified cryptographic telemetry, and enforces non-repudiation.

---

## Architecture & Core Modules
- **Interactive CLI Orchestrator (`main.py`)**: Handles argument parsing, screen cleaning, and official  banner initialization.
- **Engine Layer**: Executes domain-specific logic, risk scoring, or payload verification.
- **Evidentiary Vault**: Stores tamper-evident records authenticated via SHA-256 fingerprinting.

---

## Installation & Prerequisites
Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed on your workstation or operational node (Kali Linux / Linux / Windows PowerShell):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhostSy1/GHOST-WebScanner.git
cd GHOST-WebScanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage Guide & CLI Reference
Run the tool interactively or via command-line flags:

```bash
python3 main.py --help
python3 main.py --target <target_or_file>
```

---

## Input & Output Formats
- **Inputs**: Text files, JSON assessment reports, target lists, or configuration drops.
- **Outputs**: Structured JSON intelligence reports, CSV summaries, and tamper-evident audit ledger entries.

---

## Integration & API Contracts
**GHOST-WebScanner** integrates natively with **GHOST-Evidence-Fabric** and **GHOST-Vault** through standard JSON/CSV schema validation and SHA-256 chain verification.

---

## Security, Ethics & Authorized Scope
> **Warning**: This tool is strictly intended for authorized security testing, vulnerability research, and educational evaluations within isolated lab environments or with explicit written consent from target asset owners.

---

## Troubleshooting & FAQ
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Ensure dependencies are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Permission Denied**: Run with appropriate execution privileges or verify file access permissions.
